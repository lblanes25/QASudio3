# QA Studio Excel Reporting Project Plan - Internal Audit Focus

## Executive Summary

Development of an Excel-based reporting system for QA Studio v3 specifically designed for Internal Audit departments. The system will generate compliance reports with IAG summaries, detailed test results, audit leader scorecards, and trend analysis - all while maintaining confidentiality between audit leaders.

## Phase 1: Basic Excel Report Generation (Weeks 1-6)

### Week 1-2: Requirements & Core Infrastructure

**1.1 Report Structure Definition**
- IAG Summary Tab
  - Department-wide compliance metrics (GC/DNC/NA percentages)
  - Audit leader breakdown summary
  - Overall risk ratings
- Individual Test Tabs
  - Test description and risk rating (from rule definitions)
  - Population information (report source, filters applied)
  - Summary section with audit leader pivot-style results
  - Detailed results with all tested items

**1.2 Core Development Setup**
```

├── excel/
│   ├── generators/
│   │   ├── summary_generator.py    # IAG Summary tab
│   │   ├── test_tab_generator.py   # Individual test tabs
│   │   └── formatting.py           # Color coding (Red=DNC, Green=GC)
│   ├── models/

│   └── core/
│       ├── excel_builder.py        # Main report builder
│       └── data_aggregator.py      # Leader-level aggregations
```

### Week 3-4: Integration & Excel Generation Engine

**3.1 Early Integration**
- Connect to QA Studio validation results immediately
- Pull real rule metadata (descriptions, risk ratings)
- Use actual validation data for development

**3.2 Technology Stack**
- OpenPyXL for Excel generation
- Pandas for data aggregation
- Direct integration with QA Studio database

**3.3 Core Features Development with Real Data**
- Multi-tab workbook creation
- Conditional formatting (GC=Green, DNC=Red, NA=Gray)
- Summary calculations (GC/DNC counts by audit leader)
- Audit leader groupings
- Response columns pre-added (Internal Notes, Audit Leader Response)

### Week 5-6: Iterative Testing & Refinement

**5.1 Testing with Production Data**
- Generate reports from recent validation runs
- Verify calculations match manual reports
- Test with your largest datasets (100% population)
- Have team review output for accuracy

**5.2 Iterative Improvements**
- Adjust formatting based on team feedback
- Refine summary calculations
- Optimize for large populations
- Ensure Excel compatibility with all team members' versions

## Phase 2: Leader-Specific Distribution (Weeks 7-9)

### Week 7-8: File Splitting Logic

**7.1 Confidential Report Generation**
- Master file with all results (internal use)
- Individual leader files containing only their results
- Maintain consistent formatting across all files
- Preserve summary calculations for each subset

**7.2 File Management**
```python
output_structure/
├── Master_Reports/
│   └── QA_Results_Master_[Date].xlsx    # Complete results
├── Leader_Distribution/
│   ├── QA_Results_[Leader1]_[Date].xlsx
│   ├── QA_Results_[Leader2]_[Date].xlsx
│   └── QA_Results_[Leader3]_[Date].xlsx
```

### Week 9: Distribution Features & Testing

**9.1 Output Options**
- Configurable output directory
- Automated file naming conventions
- Generation summary report (files created, locations)
- Optional file compression for archival

**9.2 Real-World Testing**
- Generate actual leader files from recent audits
- Verify data isolation (no cross-leader data)
- Have audit leaders review their files
- Confirm master file contains all data correctly

## Phase 3: Trend Analysis (Weeks 10-12)

### Week 10-11: Historical Data Integration

**11.1 Trend Calculations**
- Store historical results by period
- Calculate compliance trends
  - Overall department trends (monthly/quarterly)
  - Individual audit leader performance over time
- Period-over-period comparisons

**11.2 Trend Visualizations**
- Excel-native charts in summary tab
- Sparklines for quick trend indicators
- Conditional formatting for trend directions

### Week 12: Trend Reporting & Validation

**12.1 New Report Tabs**
- Department Trend Analysis tab
- Leader Performance Trends tab
- Customizable time period selection
- Export-friendly chart formats

**12.2 Historical Data Testing**
- Test with multiple periods of real data
- Verify trend calculations
- Validate chart accuracy
- Get feedback on useful time periods (monthly vs quarterly)

## Phase 4: Testing, Optimization & Rollout (Weeks 13-16)

### Week 13-14: Final Testing & Optimization

**14.1 End-to-End Testing with Real Workflows**
- Run full audit cycle with new reports
- Test complete workflow from validation → report → distribution → response collection
- Verify master file updates with leader responses
- Stress test with largest historical datasets

**14.2 Performance Optimization**
- Optimize based on real usage patterns
- Fine-tune memory usage for your data volumes
- Implement parallel processing where beneficial
- Add progress indicators for long-running reports

### Week 15-16: Documentation & Deployment

**16.1 User Documentation**
- Report interpretation guide
- File distribution procedures
- Response collection workflow
- Trend analysis guide

**16.2 Deployment**

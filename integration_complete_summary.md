# Integration Complete Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. UI Updates (main_application.py)
- ✅ Removed "Generate HTML Report" checkbox
- ✅ Renamed "Generate Audit Leader-Specific Workbooks" → "Generate Individual Leader Reports" 
- ✅ Both checkboxes now checked by default
- ✅ Both checkboxes always visible (not hidden until after validation)
- ✅ Updated event handlers for new naming
- ✅ Changed report format from 'excel' to 'iag_excel'

### 2. Worker Updates (cancellable_validation_worker.py)
- ✅ Added imports for `os` and `json`
- ✅ Updated default report formats from `['excel', 'html']` to `['iag_excel']`
- ✅ Renamed internal variable to `generate_individual_reports` for clarity
- ✅ Completely replaced `_process_validation_results` method with new implementation
- ✅ Removed old leader pack generation code
- ✅ Updated validation to only generate JSON initially (Excel handled separately)

### 3. New Report Generation Flow

The new flow works as follows:

1. **Validation Phase**: 
   - Runs validation and generates JSON results only
   - Saves to: `{analytic_id}_{timestamp}_results.json`

2. **Excel Report Phase** (if checkbox is checked):
   - Calls `pipeline.generate_excel_report(json_path, excel_path)`
   - Generates: `{analytic_id}_{timestamp}_report.xlsx`

3. **Individual Reports Phase** (if both checkboxes are checked):
   - Creates subdirectory: `leader_reports_{timestamp}/`
   - Calls `pipeline.split_report_by_leader(excel_path, leader_dir)`
   - Generates individual Excel files for each leader

### 4. Integration Points

The code now properly integrates with the new reporting methods:
- `generate_excel_report()` - Creates the IAG Summary Report
- `split_report_by_leader()` - Splits master report into individual files

### 5. Backward Compatibility

- Parameter `generate_leader_packs` is still accepted but mapped to `generate_individual_reports`
- Signal emissions remain the same for UI compatibility
- 'leader_packs' type still used in report completion signal

## What's Different

### Old System:
- Generated Excel/HTML during validation
- Used template-based report generator
- Leader packs were a separate complex process

### New System:
- Validation only generates JSON
- Excel generation happens after validation using IAG format
- Individual reports are simply split from the master report
- Much cleaner separation of concerns

## Testing Checklist

1. [ ] Run validation with only Excel report checked
2. [ ] Run validation with both Excel and Individual reports checked  
3. [ ] Run validation with neither checked (JSON only)
4. [ ] Verify Individual reports warning shows without responsible party column
5. [ ] Verify files are created in correct directories with matching timestamps
6. [ ] Check that report completion signals are properly emitted

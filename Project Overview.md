Risk Mitigation & Success Factors
Critical Success Factors:

Thread Safety: All long operations must run in background threads
Progress Feedback: Users need clear indication of operation status
Error Recovery: Graceful handling of validation failures and data issues
Performance: Responsive UI even with large datasets and complex rules
State Persistence: User workflow should survive application restarts

Risk Mitigation:

Memory Management: Implement lazy loading and data pagination for large results
Error Handling: Comprehensive exception handling with user-friendly messages
Testing Strategy: Unit tests for workers, integration tests for backend connections
Documentation: Inline help and tooltips for complex functionality
Backward Compatibility: Version configuration files and provide migration paths

This plan provides a solid foundation for building a professional, scalable analytics runner interface while maintaining clear separation between UI and business logic layers.

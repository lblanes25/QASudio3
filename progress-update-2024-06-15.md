# Progress Update - June 15, 2024

## Changes Since Last GitHub Push

### 1. Fixed party_results Missing from Validation Output
- **Issue**: Validation results weren't including party_results needed for severity-weighted scoring
- **Root Cause**: RuleEvaluationResult.summary property wasn't including party_results
- **Fix**: Updated `core/rule_engine/rule_evaluator.py` to include party_results in summary when present
- **Impact**: Enables severity-weighted IAG scoring when responsible_party_column is specified

### 2. Implemented Executive-Friendly Section 1
- **Location**: `services/validation_service.py` - `_generate_section1_iag_overall()`
- **Changes from Plan**:
  - Replaced confusing intermediate calculations (Total Score, GC Score, PC Score, DNC Score) with executive metrics
  - Added: Total Analytics Tested, Total Data Points Reviewed, Number of Audit Leaders
  - Kept: Overall Compliance Rate, Overall Rating, Override fields
  - Added robust fallback logic when severity weighting unavailable
  - Added debug logging for troubleshooting
- **Severity Weighting**: Now working with Critical=3x, High=2x, Medium/Low=1x multipliers

### 3. Implemented Section 2: Audit Leader Results
- **Location**: `services/validation_service.py` - `_generate_section2_leader_results()`
- **Features**:
  - Individual IAG scores and ratings for each audit leader
  - Column headers: Audit Leader, Total Tests, GC, PC, DNC, NA, Compliance Rate, Rating, Override Rating, Rationale
  - Alternating row colors for readability
  - Totals row at bottom
  - Proper column widths for all fields

### 4. Implemented Section 3: Detailed Analytics
- **Location**: `services/validation_service.py` - `_generate_section3_detailed_analytics()`
- **Features**:
  - Matrix view: Analytics (rows) × Audit Leaders (columns)
  - Shows each rule with metadata (ID, name, severity, threshold)
  - Displays compliance status for each leader on each rule
  - Uses party_results when available, falls back to overall status
  - Color coding with legend
  - Leader totals at bottom (GC:X/PC:Y/DNC:Z format)
  - 45-degree rotated leader names for space efficiency

### 5. Updated Test Files
- **test_iag_report.py**: Updated to match new executive-friendly format
- **test_complete_iag_report.py**: New test to verify all three sections generate correctly
- **check_results_structure.py**: Debug script to analyze JSON structure
- **fix_test_processor.py**: Removed as no longer needed

### Additional Updates (June 16, 2024)

#### 6. Fixed Color Coding Issues in Sections 2 & 3
- **Issue**: Alternating row colors were overwriting rating colors
- **Fix**: Applied rating colors AFTER alternating row formatting
- **Location**: `_generate_section2_leader_results()` and `_generate_section3_detailed_analytics()`

#### 7. Fixed Data Type Issues
- **Issue**: Percentages stored as text preventing Excel formulas
- **Fix**: Store decimal values with number formatting instead of pre-formatted strings
- **Affected**: Compliance rates, weighted scores, error thresholds

#### 8. Removed Redundant Leader Totals from Section 3
- **Issue**: Leader totals duplicated information from Section 2
- **Fix**: Removed totals row to avoid confusion
- **Rationale**: Section 2 already provides comprehensive leader summaries

#### 9. Implemented Enhanced Test Tabs
- **Header Section**: Test name, description, risk rating, population, error threshold
- **Audit Leader Summary**: Per-leader results with compliance rates and status
- **Detailed Results Section**: 100% population coverage with all test items

## Phase 2: Leader File Splitting (June 16, 2024)

### Week 7-8: Split Logic ✅ COMPLETE

#### 12. Implemented split_report_by_leader() Method
- **Location**: `services/validation_service.py`
- **Features**:
  - Loads master report and identifies all audit leaders from Section 2
  - Creates individual workbooks for each leader
  - Complete data isolation - removes all other leaders' data
  - Preserves all formatting from master report
  - Generates timestamped filenames: `QA_Results_{LeaderName}_{Timestamp}.xlsx`

#### 13. IAG Summary Report Splitting
- **Section 1**: Copied as-is (department-wide data)
- **Section 2**: Only the specific leader's row retained
- **Section 3**: Only the specific leader's column retained
- All other leaders' data completely removed from these sections

#### 14. Test Tab Filtering
- Only includes test tabs where the leader has results
- **Audit Leader Summary**: Shows only their row
- **Detailed Test Results**: Shows only their items
- Maintains all formatting and column widths

#### 15. Guide Tab Preservation
- Guide tab copied as-is to all leader files
- Ensures every leader has access to instructions

#### 16. Added Convenience Method
- `generate_and_split_reports()`: Creates master and splits in one operation
- Organizes files into timestamped directories
- Returns paths to all generated files

### Files Modified for Phase 2

```
M services/validation_service.py
A test_leader_split.py
M progress-update-2024-06-15.md
```

### Test Status for Phase 2

- ✅ Leader identification from Section 2
- ✅ Individual file creation with proper naming
- ✅ Data isolation verified (no other leaders' data)
- ✅ Formatting preservation confirmed
- ✅ Guide tab included in all files

### Phase 2 Summary

Leader file splitting is now **COMPLETE** and ready for production use. The implementation:
- Creates completely isolated reports for each leader
- Maintains professional formatting from the master
- Includes only relevant test tabs for each leader
- Provides the Guide tab for reference
- Uses clear, timestamped filenames

#### 17. Fixed Audit Leader Summary Counts (Critical Fix)
- **Issue**: Items Tested and status counts showed as zeros in individual test tabs
- **Root Cause**: party_results didn't include detailed count information
- **Solution**: Calculate counts from _result_details when available
- **Implementation**: Added fallback logic to count statuses from detailed results
- **Result**: Accurate counts now display (e.g., Items Tested: 5, GC: 4, DNC: 1)

### Phase 2 Final Test Results

Successfully generated and verified 5 leader files:
- ✅ Angela Wilson - Shows 5 items tested with accurate GC/DNC counts
- ✅ Jonathan Johnson - Complete data isolation verified
- ✅ Kevin Nicholson - All formatting preserved
- ✅ Kristen Walker - Only their test results included
- ✅ Michelle Ware - Guide tab included for reference

Example from Angela Wilson's report:
```
Audit Leader Summary
Audit Leader    Items Tested    GC    PC    DNC    NA    Compliance Rate    Status
Angela Wilson   5               4     0     1      0     80.0%              PC
```

The Detailed Test Results correctly show all 5 items with appropriate statuses and failure reasons.

### Phase 2 Implementation Complete

Both the master report generation (Phase 1) and leader file splitting (Phase 2) are now production-ready with:
- Full IAG compliance scoring
- Complete data isolation per leader
- Accurate item counts and status calculations
- Professional formatting throughout
- Clear documentation via Guide tab

## UI Bug Fixes and Improvements (June 16, 2024)

### 18. Fixed "toPlainText" Error on Results Tree Widget
- **Issue**: `'ResultsTreeWidget' object has no attribute 'toPlainText'` error when generating reports
- **Root Cause**: Code was treating the tree widget as a text widget
- **Fix**: Updated to use `load_results()` method to properly update the tree with report files
- **Location**: `ui/analytics_runner/main_application.py` line 3655

### 19. Fixed "results_data" AttributeError
- **Issue**: `'AnalyticsRunnerApp' object has no attribute 'results_data'` when generating reports
- **Root Cause**: results_data was never initialized or stored
- **Fix**: 
  - Added `self.results_data = None` in constructor
  - Store results in `_on_validation_complete()` method
- **Location**: `ui/analytics_runner/main_application.py` lines 227 and 3372

### 20. Fixed "Internal C++ object already deleted" Error
- **Issue**: QLabel widgets being accessed after deletion when running validation multiple times
- **Root Cause**: Worker signals remained connected to deleted widgets
- **Fix**:
  - Disconnect all signals from previous worker before creating new one
  - Added safety checks in all signal handlers (`_on_progress_updated`, `_on_status_updated`, `_on_rule_started`)
  - Added try-except blocks to handle RuntimeError for deleted widgets
  - Deferred QMessageBox display using QTimer to avoid event loop issues
- **Location**: Multiple methods in `ui/analytics_runner/main_application.py`

### 21. Attempted Auto-Selection of Responsible Party Column
- **Request**: Default to "AuditLeader" if present in data columns
- **Implementation**: Added code to check for "AuditLeader" column and auto-select
- **Decision**: Reverted due to column name variations (Audit Leader, audit_leader, Audit Leader from AE, etc.)
- **Result**: Kept manual selection to ensure accuracy
